#### 1. Synopsis

This project involves the design and implementation of an edge computing node capable of monitoring the operational health of industrial induction motors. Utilizing an ESP32 microcontroller, the system captures high-frequency vibration and thermal data to detect anomalies indicative of bearing faults, misalignment, or overheating. Unlike traditional telemetry systems that transmit raw data, this device performs on-device signal processing (Edge AI) to calculate Root Mean Square (RMS) acceleration and spectral variance, transmitting only critical health metrics to a centralized dashboard via MQTT.

#### 2. Technical Report

**2.1 Problem Statement and Societal Necessity** In the industrial sector, unplanned equipment downtime costs the global economy billions of dollars annually. Traditional "run-to-failure" maintenance strategies are inefficient and dangerous. In our society, this inefficiency translates to higher production costs, increased energy consumption due to degrading machinery, and safety hazards for factory workers. There is a critical need for low-cost, retrofittable solutions that can predict equipment failure before it occurs (Predictive Maintenance).

**2.2 Key Features**

- **High-Frequency Data Acquisition:** Sampling accelerometer data at 1kHz to capture fine vibration nuances.

- **Edge Computing:** On-board calculation of Velocity RMS (ISO 10816 standard compliant) and peak acceleration.

- **Wireless Telemetry:** Secure data transmission over Wi-Fi using the MQTT protocol.

- **Thermal Monitoring:** Simultaneous casing temperature tracking to correlate vibration spikes with thermal runaway.

- **Fault Alerting:** Local status indication and remote payload triggers when thresholds are breached.

**2.3 Innovation and Differentiation** Most student projects merely stream raw sensor data to a cloud, which consumes massive bandwidth and introduces latency. This project stands out because it implements **Edge Intelligence**. By processing data locally on the ESP32, we reduce bandwidth usage by 95% and ensure that safety alerts are generated in milliseconds, not seconds. This architecture mimics modern commercial solutions like those from Bosch or Siemens.

**2.4 Cost Analysis and Feasibility** The system is designed for high scalability and low entry cost.

- **ESP32-WROOM-32 Dev Kit:** $6.00

- **MPU-6050 (Accelerometer/Gyroscope):** $4.00

- **Miscellaneous (PCB, wiring, casing):** $5.00

- **Total Prototype Cost:** ~$15.00
  Compared to industrial vibration sensors which often cost upwards of $500, this solution is highly feasible for mass deployment in small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs).

**2.5 Business Model** The commercial viability of this project lies in a **Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS)** model.

- **Direct Sales:** Selling the hardware nodes to factories.

- **SaaS Subscription:** Charging a monthly fee for the analytics dashboard that visualizes the data and provides automated monthly health reports.

- **Consulting:** Offering installation and calibration services based on specific motor types.
